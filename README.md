# Adderall

A tiny macOS menu bar app that toggles `sudo pmset -a disablesleep` with one click.

- **Click the icon**: toggle sleep disabled ⇄ allowed
- **Launch the `.app` again**: open the settings window (handled via app reopen)
- The icon reflects the state (💊 filled pill = staying awake / 💊 hollow pill = sleep allowed)
- Lives only in the menu bar; no Dock icon (it appears in the Dock only while settings are open)

## Settings

While Adderall is running in the menu bar, launching the `.app` again opens the settings window:

- **Launch at login** — register/unregister a login item via `SMAppService`
- **Also prevent display sleep** — while active, keeps the display awake with `caffeinate -d` (no root, fully reversible)
- **Passwordless execution status** — shown as ✓/✗; if not set up, the "Set up" button installs it via a single admin prompt
- **Quit Adderall** — quit button (there is no menu, so quit from here)

## Setup

### 1. Allow passwordless execution (first run only)

`disablesleep` requires root, so only that specific command is made password-free via sudoers.
Use the settings window's "Set up" button, or run it in a terminal:

```sh
./scripts/install-sudoers.sh
```

This installs `/etc/sudoers.d/adderall-disablesleep` with only these lines (no other pmset operations are allowed):

```
<user> ALL=(root) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/pmset -a disablesleep 0
<user> ALL=(root) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/pmset -a disablesleep 1
```

To remove it: `sudo rm /etc/sudoers.d/adderall-disablesleep`.

### 2. Build and run

```sh
./scripts/build-app.sh
open Adderall.app
```

> Launch with `open`, not by running the executable directly — a directly launched binary may not register in the menu bar.

## Releases / downloads

Publishing a GitHub Release triggers `.github/workflows/release.yml`, which builds `Adderall.app`
and attaches a DMG (`Adderall-<tag>.dmg`) containing an `/Applications` symlink for drag-to-install.
Open the DMG and drag Adderall into Applications.

Example release flow:

```sh
gh release create v0.1.0 --generate-notes
# after publishing, Actions builds the DMG and attaches it to the release
```

> On push / PR, `build.yml` only verifies the build and uploads `Adderall.zip` as a workflow artifact.

Builds are **ad-hoc signed** (not notarized), so Gatekeeper warns on first launch. To bypass:

- In Finder, right-click `Adderall.app` → "Open", or
- `xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /Applications/Adderall.app`

## Auto-update

Adderall checks GitHub Releases for a newer version on launch, and you can check
manually from the settings window ("Check for updates"). When a newer version exists,
it offers to download the release DMG, replace the running app in place, and relaunch.

Because the updater strips the quarantine attribute when it swaps the app, the Gatekeeper
warning above only appears on the **first** manual install — subsequent auto-updates open
without a warning. (Updates are fetched over HTTPS from GitHub; there is no Developer ID /
EdDSA signature check beyond TLS.)

> The build's version comes from the git tag (`APP_VERSION` / `git describe`), so the
> in-app version matches the release tag. The first build that contains this updater must
> be installed manually; updates are automatic from there on.

## How it works

- State is read from the `SleepDisabled` line of `pmset -g` (no root)
- Toggling runs `sudo -n /usr/bin/pmset -a disablesleep {0,1}` (assumes passwordless setup; shows a prompt if missing)
- Passwordless availability is detected with `sudo -k -n …`, which ignores any cached sudo timestamp so it reflects only the sudoers rule
- Display sleep is controlled by starting/stopping a `caffeinate -d` process
- State is re-read every 5 seconds, so changes made elsewhere (e.g. a terminal) are picked up

## Development

```sh
swift build          # debug build
./scripts/build-app.sh && open Adderall.app
```
